"""Tests for the dataflow as a setup choice: validated at the wizard boundary, and
applied as one operation rather than a setting at a time.

Two guarantees are worth holding onto. A choice nothing recognises is refused where
the researcher gave it, not silently replaced by a default downstream --- a study
quietly collecting the wrong way is the failure that shows up weeks later in the
coverage grid. And a dataflow this deployment cannot honour stops the run before
anything is written, so there is no half-configured study to unpick.

The MySQL binding is the deployment's half of the choice. The published port exists
only so participant phones can open the database themselves, which is what the
direct path needs; every service in the compose file reaches MySQL over the compose
network, so on the webservice path the published address has no audience beyond
this host and is narrowed to loopback.
